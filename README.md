# BetterDiscord-CFGH

Some themes and a plugin, inspired by an old Wikia chat

Contains:

* `WikiaEmotes.plugin.js` - replaces the discord emotes with the ones provided by Wikia
* `cfgh.theme.css` - Light theme
* `cfgh-dark.theme.css` - Dark theme

*Theme may not look pretty. Also, trigger warning: comic sans
